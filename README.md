# Every-Glimesh-Chat

*This process will be updated in the future*

This is a nodeJS script to observe every chat on Glimesh.tv at the same time. You will need a client ID or an access token for authentication. You also need windows terminal.

To get started download the repo. Navigate to the folder and run `npm install` in the terminal. Then you need to add your client ID/access token to the index.js file.

You need to replace the file path at the bottom of the file (in the fs.write) with the path to the settings file of windows terminal. You can get the path by hitting the down arrow on the current tab and selectings settings. Save the file and open quick access. This will let you see the file path. Paste in it the proper place in index.js
